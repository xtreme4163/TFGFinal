*SwarmPackagePy* is the package, witch contains the following swarm optimization algorithms:

1. Artificial Bee Algorithm
2. Bat Algorithm
3. Bacterial Foraging Optimization
4. Cat Swarm Optimization
5. Chicken Swarm Optimization
6. Cuckoo Search Optimization
7. Firefly algorithm
8. Firework Algorithm
9. Gravitational Search Algorithm
10. Grey Wolf Optimizer
11. Harmony Search
12. Particle Swarm Optimization
13. Social Spider Algorithm
14. Whale Swarm Algorithm

Every algorithm has arguments listed below:

* n: number of agents
* function: test function
* lb: lower limits for plot axes
* ub: upper limits for plot axes
* dimension: space dimension
* iteration: number of iterations

Every algorithm has methods listed below:

* get_agents(): returns a history of all agents of the algorithm
* get_Gbest(): returns the best position of algorithm
